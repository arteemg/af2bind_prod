# AF2Bind: lightweight and fast prediction of protein-peptide and protein-ligand binding sites 
The accurate prediction of ligand-binding sites in proteins remains an outstanding challenge, despite its potential to accelerate drug discovery and inform on natural protein function. Protein-peptide and protein-ligand interactions play an important role in cell signaling by carrying out essential biological processes. Here, we train a neural network, AF2BIND, using embedding features from a protein structure prediction model, AlphaFold2, to accurately predict the binding epitopes of proteins from single structures. AF2BIND effectively captures binding signatures of small-molecule- and peptide-binding sites, without knowledge of the true ligand.
